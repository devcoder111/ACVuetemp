      CRM Together has partners (resellers) and customers in over 10 countries. We develop software with a focus on UX (User experience) with the aim to make it easy to use and intuitive. Since 2010 we have been heavily involved in the Sage CRM community exhibiting at trade shows in Canada, USA, Germany and the UK. We sell in Germany via a distributor and our products work in English and German. Our approach to projects is to explore different ways of solving problems and figure out the method that will work best for the BP and the customer.
